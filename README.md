Web Application Development Master Branch

## Our Workflow/Visual Studio Live Share

We use a Visual Studio Code extension called Live Share for our coding session. This involves everyone collabaratively working on the code simultaneously, similar to working together in Google Drive. For this to work, all of the changes to this project are made on one team member's machine in any given session.

Because of this, work done by the group as a whole will usually be committed and pushed to the repository under one user's name, even though that user may not have neccessarily done all of that work alone, and it is usually a team effort between at least two team members.

## Licence

All work not mentioned below is built from scratch in Ruby on Rails by the SEED ORG Rails Team, Scott Ross and Marcus Geary.

### Base User and Session Fuctionality
The user registration, log-in, log-out, and persistent session functionality of this program are built with the help of Michael Hartl's book *[Ruby in Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-6th-edition-tutorial#copyright_and_license)*, which is published under the MIT License and the Beerware License.

The Beerware Licence provided by Hartl can be found below.
